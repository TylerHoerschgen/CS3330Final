This Java game was made as a final program for a Java Object Oriented Programming course I took, however, I also made this game for fun.  I spent a ton of time on and I’m proud of what I have. Some of the code may seem strange due to the limitations of JavaFX and the FXMLLoader, but I did my best with what I knew. I’ve tested the game thoroughly and everything works as intended. In the future I may add the ability to swap the position of Java Monsters and add types to each monster. I was thinking of having four types, water, earth, fire, and air.  

Purpose

The purpose of this game was to push my knowledge of Java and object-oriented principles to the limits. I learned a lot while creating this game and I’m glad that I created it. For those playing the game, the purpose is to beat the final trainer and maybe even attempt to beat my world record.  

Required Information 

This game is a heavily inspired from the Pokémon games. I used to play them for hours and hours when I was a kid, so they hold a special place in my heart. When you start, you will notice a path leading to the left, right, and upwards. To the left is the shop where you can buy fruit and JavaBalls. To the right of the is the Health Center where you can heal your Java Monsters. Heading upwards leads to the battles. You can encounter a wild Java Monster by walking through the grass or battle a trainer by following the trail upwards again. 

How to Play 

You move your character with w,a,s,d or arrow keys. You start with one Java Monster, Crookodile, and your primary objective is to beat the sixth and final trainer, Strong Man Sam. To beat Sam, you will have to capture Java Monsters and train them to a high level. The Trainers get progressively harder leading up to Sam so don’t be afraid to battle them. The only way to obtain new Java Monsters is to buy JavaBalls from the Shop and use them on wild Java Monster. You cannot catch trainer’s Java Monsters. You can have a maximum of six Java Monsters. To train you Java Monsters you must battle and defeat enemy monsters. When you battle enough enemy monsters your Java Monster will level up. Leveling up increases your monsters attack and defense. I’ve included save files in the project if you want to load those. One starts on the final battle with Sam. 

How to Battle 

The battles with wild monsters or with trainers have the same controls. You continue the battle by clicking in the TextArea. The battles are turn based and the starting side is random. When it’s your turn, you can fight, heal, or catch. The fight button attacks the enemy dealing damage based on your Java Monster’s level and the enemy’s level. Pressing the “bag” button opens a menu to use fruit or to use a JavaBall. Fruit can only be used if your Java Monster’s health isn’t full and you have at least one JavaBall. JavaBalls attempt to catch the enemy monster, but once again, it cannot be a trainer’s monster. The battle ends whenever the enemy monster is caught, or you win or lose the battle. That’s all you need to know. Good luck!
